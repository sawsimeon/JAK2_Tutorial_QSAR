The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 mL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384-well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser. Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 uL of 1.11x enzyme and 1.11x substrate in 1x assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer #PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 mL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384-well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser. Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 uL of 1.11x enzyme and 1.11x substrate in 1x assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer #PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 uL of 10xATP in 1x assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction.",37,BindingDB Database,Homo sapiens,NA,9606,Autocuration,BAO_0000357,10938,CHEMBL2971,SINGLE PROTEIN,O60674,Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2,Homo sapiens,9,Protein,NA,NA,94711,CHEMBL3638646,NA,NA,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3.95,3.95,359.381,3,3,2,96.72,4,45,15,11,0.733333333,4,2,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,12,12,4,0,0,0,0,15

Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1.

Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1.

Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1.

Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1.

One or more compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the following in vitro assay described in Park et al., Analytical Biochemistry 1999, 269, 94-104. The catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) and JAK3 (a.a. 781-1124) with an N-terminal His tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF).

Reactions were incubated at 22° C. in 384-well polypropylene microtiter plates for 30 minutes and then stopped by addition of 250 µL of an EDTA containing solution (100 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 150 mM EDTA), resulting in a final EDTA concentration of 50 mM. After termination of the kinase reaction, the proportion of phosphorylated product was determined as a fraction of total peptide substrate using the Caliper LabChip 3000 according to the manufacturer's specifications.

The assays were performed in V-bottom 384-well plates. The final assay volume was 30 ul prepared from 15 ul additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Beta-Glycerolphosphate, 0.015% Brij35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of JAK2 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP 3000 by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The ability of compounds to inhibit the activity of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 was measured using a recombinant purified GST-tagged catalytic domain for each enzyme (Invitrogen JAK1 #M4290, JAK2 #M4290, JAK3 #M4290, Tyk2 #M4290) in an HTRF format biochemical assay. The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 mL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384-well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser. Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 uL of 1.11x enzyme and 1.11x substrate in 1x assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer #PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at ambient temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.
